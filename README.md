# My First Three.js Project

Just a simple program I put together while learning Three.js. It displays some floating donuts with changeable colors and allows you to input custom 3D text.

**Features:**

* Displays multiple floating donut shapes.
* Allows modification of the donut colors.
* Generates 3D text based on user input.

**Live Demo:**

**How to Use:**

1.  Open the provided link.
2.  Look for controls to adjust the color of the donuts.
3.  Locate the text input field to enter custom text that will appear in 3D.
4.  (If implemented) You might be able to navigate the scene to view it from different angles.

**About This:**

This was created as an exercise in learning the basics of Three.js for web-based 3D graphics. It involves:

* Creating basic 3D geometry (donuts).
* Applying materials and colors to objects.
* Positioning and basic animation of elements.
* Implementing user interaction for color and text input.
* Generating 3D geometry from text.


Feel free to take a look.
